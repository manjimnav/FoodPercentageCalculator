# FoodPercentageCalculator
This repository contains a notebook with an example of Deep Learning applied to regression. 
The objective is to calculate the percentage of pixels of food in an image.
There is three versions:
* Regression from scratch.
* Regression with transfer learning from an classification model.
* Regression with transfer learning from an segmentation model.

The dataset used is in http://www.ivl.disco.unimib.it/activities/food-recognition/
- TODO:
- [] Refactorize code.
- [] Use another segmentation models.
- [] Check another augmentation methods.
